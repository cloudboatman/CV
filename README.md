<h3>Profile</strong></h3>
<p>I am looking to become a full-stack web developer. My previous role required me to learn HTML, CSS, Razor Syntax, Ruby, PHP and Javascript for a variety of projects. However, this was only one aspect of my role and therefore my other responsibilities prevented me from delving further into coding. I therefore decided to move into what I love full time. I have taken a break to travel and since coming back have been teaching myself Javascript in the hope of finding my first role as a Junior Developer.</p>

<h3>Technical Skills Developed</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS (including grid systems)</li>
<li>Javascript and jQuery</li>
<li>Ruby and Rails</li>
<li>Object orientated programming</li>
<li>Test driven design</li>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Git and Github</li>
<li>Mirth and Systems Integration</li>
<li>Familiar with Agile development concepts</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Can I Offer?</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Practical leadership skills</em> – Have managed multiple teams and GP practices over the last five years. Managing GP’s requires a very different skillset to managing admin assistants and I have therefore learnt to maintain a flexible management style.</li>
<li><em>People Skills and Teamwork</em> – I have worked with a wide range of people. I have had to deal with angry patients, top level consultants, multiple outside contractors including digital agencies and have received consistent feedback that I am approachable, supportive and a good listener. I am always willing to do anything to help others succeed and provide any support necessary.</li>
<li><em>Ability to work under pressure</em> – I have worked in roles that had responsibilities spanning every department in the business and still managed to bring multiple complex projects in on time. I have managed two surgeries simultaneously, one which ran from 8am-8pm, 365 days a year and operated as a surgery, walk-in service and a medical provider for a care home with nearly 100 highly dependent patients.</li>
<li><em>Fast Learner</em> – I have consistently had to take on projects and roles with seriously limited time constraints, because I am able to pick up new skills and systems quickly. In my last role I helped with the development of an outcomes system, website, intranet, data visualisation system and patient app with little to no previous experience to draw on each time.</li>
<li><em>Curiosity</em> - The main reason I am able to learn new skills quickly is curiosity. I am happiest when learning new skills and as such software development, a field where you are continuously learning, matches my mentality perfectly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<h4>The Fortius Clinic - Private orthopaedic and sports injury group</h4>
<p><em>October 2012 - January 2017</em></p>

<p>My initial role at Fortius was as Research and Outcomes Coordinator, I was then promoted to Surgical Programme and Outcomes Manager, then to Information Manager and finally Business Analyst.</p>

<p>As <strong>Research and Outcomes Coordinator</strong> I was tasked with helping in the early stages of developing a patient recorded outcomes collection system that collated data provided by patients and clinicians. This involved constructing certain parts of the system, instructing consultants and nurses on its use, setting up our internal processes for gathering the data and contacting patients to gather the data. My main focus was on automation and data quality. Our patient base grew rapidly, therefore manual collation of data was an impossible task. I created automated email templates using razor syntax in order to contact patients, helped construct the forms for data collation and developed multiple Excel dashboards for internal use.</p>

<p>As <strong>Surgical Programme and Outcomes Manager</strong> I was tasked with overall management of the system and headed a team concerned with collating the data and maintaining the system. My role expanded into other areas of the business as I helped develop the new website using Joomla, led the construction of an intranet also in Joomla and became heavily involved in the surgical side of the business, particularly in analysis and forecasting.</p>

<p>As <strong>Information Manager</strong> and <strong>Business Analyst</strong> I spent more time working on widely varying projects while still managing the outcomes team. My projects during this time included the development of an internal data resource and data visualisation tool, which aimed to take all the data collated by our multitude of systems and bring them into a single repository (Couch DB) before manipulating them to provide business information to multiple parties. This was initially built in Ruby On Rails, but was later converted to React JS. I was part of a team that led the creation of a Fortius Patient App, which due to its ingenuity has now had some plaudits and news coverage. I led the integration of Workplace by Facebook into our company, meeting with Facebook in order to set up the implementation plan. I was responsible for the integration of a new surgical system with out current patient management system, using Mirth to create an interface between the two and our data repository system. To do this I had to teach myself Javascript in order to create the filters and transformers that would control the flow of data. While working on all these projects I was also in charge of providing data for all areas of the business and setting up automated processes so they could produce the data themselves in future.</p> 

<h4>The Practice Plc – Primary care company</h4>
<p><em>October 2011 – October 2012</em></p>
<p>When my role as a management trainee ended prematurely I was rehired immediately as an interim practice manager and had experience of running four separate surgeries over six months. At the end of this six month period I was offered a permanent position running a challenging surgery in Milton Keynes. This was a result of my performance over that period and as such became the only management trainee to progress so quickly, and was one of only two who ended up in a management position, despite joining 6 months later than the first intake.</p>

<h4>Stag Pub, Chorleywood</h4>
<p><em>June 2008 – December 2010</em></p>

<h4>Off to Work - Catering and Events Company</h4>
<p><em>October 2009 – August 2010</em></p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>University of Birmingham 2007 - 2010</br>

<p>I chose to take modules in Sociology, Media Studies and Art History to complement my historical studies and broaden my education.</p>
<p>Dissertation concerning the Reformation in Europe: 1st</p>

<h3>Other Interests</h3>
<p>Sport, cooking, travelling, literature and film</p>
<p>I am an obsessive cook and am currently in the process of setting up a street food stall as a side project.</p>
<p>I love travelling and have recently come back from a six month stint in Sri Lanka, India, Nepal and Vietnam. I wrote a blog about my experiences here.</p>
